                    <p>As a part of astronomy, astrophysics deals with the study of celestial bodies by applying the
                        laws of physics and chemistry. The field applies laws of different subjects like
                        thermodynamics, molecular physics, relativity, particle physics, etc. This book unfolds the
                        innovative aspects of astrophysics, which will be crucial for the holistic understanding of the
                        subject matter.</p>

                        textbook. It explains modern cosmological concepts, such as dark energy, in the context of the
                        Big Bang theory. Its clear, lucid writing style, with a wealth of useful everyday analogies,
                        makes t exceptionally engaging.</p>
